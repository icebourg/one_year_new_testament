# One Year New Testament

When I was 19 or 20, I picked up a copy of the [One Year New Testament](https://www.amazon.com/NLT-One-Year-Bible-New-Testament/dp/1414310722) after a pastor recommended it to me. In the decade+ since then, I've frequently gone back to this reading plan for its simplicity and (extremely!) quick read. I took this Bible with me on my first mission trip to Uganda where I got caught in a massive African downpour, and held in my backpocket, it hasn't quit been the same since. :)

I have no claim of ownership of this arrangement of verses, I just really, really like how accessible it makes the New Testament. Therefore I've put together this repo to preserve the daily arrangement in the hopes it will be useful to someone else. If you spot an error, please let me know and open a pull request!
